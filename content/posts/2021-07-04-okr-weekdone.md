OKR 作為企業與個人的目標設定心法, 已經是當代顯學. 然而, 

1. 如何快速 思考/撰寫 良好/有效的 OKR
2. 並持續追蹤, 確定自己在正軌上

是目前我將 OKR 運用在人生目標設定上, 遇到最大的難題.

<!--more-->

現況 (2021-07-04) 多是使用表格來追蹤, 但整理費時, 每次都還是要重新思考, 所以才有了找軟體輔助的想法. 以下整理 Weekdone 相關內容。才剛起步, 也不確定是否真的好用, 後續有心得再持續更新。

選擇主因

1. Free.
2. 教學資源完整. [Learning Center](https://weekdone.com/learning/manager/okr-theory) 
3. 介面直接提示各種範例. [OKR Examples](https://okrexamples.co/)


## Learning Center


* [Actionable Objectives](https://weekdone.com/learning/manager/okr-theory/write-good-okrs/4-rules-for-writing-actionable-goals-with-okrs)

寫好目標的 4 條規則

1. 規則 1：正確識別問題
   1. RCA: 挖掘問題的根本原因並收集數據是編寫好的團隊目標的第一步。
2. 規則 2：不斷問為什麼
   1. 5 Whys ![5-whys](https://static.weekdone.com/wp-content/uploads/Actionable-Objectives.png)
   2. O: Implement best practice weekly status reporting and improve teamwork. ![O](https://static.weekdone.com/wp-content/uploads/Actionable-Objectives-LC.png)
   3. KR1: avg(meeting_time): 120min -> 45min
   4. KR2: complete_rate(weekly_plans) > 90%
   5. KR3: implement TOP 3 of the most upvoted improvement ideas from the team
3. 規則 3：為頭腦風暴會議做好準備
4. 規則 4：專注於重要的事情
   1. 不要試圖超越自己並解決您將來可能遇到或可能不會遇到的問題。 

> 如果我們必須將整篇文章總結為一句話，我們會說：您的 OKR 應該只關注現在可能產生最大影響的事情，其他一切都應該等待。當你追逐一切時，你什麼也得不到。
