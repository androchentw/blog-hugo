2023-04-04 A thousand expectations I originally wanted to release on April Fool's Day.

Recently, thanks to ChatGPT, I have made many new friends. I am very grateful for the attention and hope that I can continue to present insightful knowledge points to you. In summary, I will define the positioning of this blog, the content I expect to cover, and try to launch a [free newsletter][news-ss]. If you have any feedback or ideas, please feel free to send a private message or email. Let's grow together and explore the journey of technology/life.

ü§î Q: What knowledge do you want to gain?

üí™ A: Subscribe to the [newsletter][news-ss]!

> I'm using ChatGPT and other software to help translate the original and future valuable articles. If there are any unclear expressions, please feel free to let me know. I'm also working hard to learn English and Japanese!

## What are the features of ProgramMur?

> It's not so much a promise as an expectation of my own knowledge output.

Actually, I didn't intend to make it sound too great. I originally wanted to change from "reading many articles but not retaining any useful information" to "speaking in my own words" and even sharing with like-minded people. Through recent postings, I have gradually begun to grasp my favorite patterns. It will probably be in the following ways:

1. **Information visualization**: Brief diagramming through Markdown + Mindmap + Blocks.
2. **Q&A**: Invite everyone to grow together with **Socratic questioning**. I will also try my best to practice:
   1. Key questions "ü§î Q: [Question]"
   2. Take action "üí™ A: [Action]"
3. **Measurement**: 1 original article per week, 50 original articles per year. Keep up with my timeline and grow agilely without being FOMO.

The main articles will be divided into the following 3 categories

| Type | Content |
| --- | --- |
| **Volume: Summarize** | Organize new knowledge Summary of opinions + CTA |
| **Depth: Analyze** |  In-depth analysis, easy-to-understand, diagramming context |
| **Width: Share** |  Inspiration/ingenuity |

## Free newsletter

Original articles will be sent out as newsletters:

1. 1-2 newsletters per week.
2. Articles are around 3000 words, readable within 6 minutes.

The content focuses on "**Explore tech journey**"

1. **Explore**: Stay fresh and passionate about this rapidly changing world.
2. **Tech**: Focusing on technology, which also includes business, life, and personal growth aspects.
3. **Journey**: As a tech traveler, I will share my perspectives.

I am still trying various suitable solutions and will share more insights as they become available.

> Currently, all articles are free and published on https://blog.androchen.tw/en. By subscribing to the free newsletter, you can be informed of the latest content instantly. If you think my articles have brought value to you, subscribing is the greatest support for me, and I would also be very happy to receive your sponsorship!

## From Point of View to Insight

> Q: There are already many technology communities, why add another one?

This is more like a **technology travelogue**. As with my original naming, each article is like my murmur of thoughts. Further thinking, I believe I want to clarify the following 3 things through articles:

1. I: What I see
2. You: What you hope to gain
3. We: What more can we think about together

In addition to technological new knowledge, I want to share and discuss "points of view and insights". In the workplace, we are often asked for insight: "What is your insight?" That is to say, what we observe is a fact (a 300 ml cup filled with 150 ml of water), but what do you see? What do you want to say? (Only half left? Still half left?)

<p align="center"><sub><sup>
  What is your insight?
</sup></sub></p>

> The perspectives we choose, along with the traces of time, shape our personalities.

Those self-talking words that used to be sealed in diaries won't change much after a long time. With AI assistance, there will inevitably be more articles. I want to go further on this road and **leave my own footprints**. Just like traveling, you don't just want to read about a single attraction, take pictures, and check in. You also want to sigh a word or two. I think those are the **proofs of being alive**.

## Brand Design

I also played with the logo design for free on [namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/logo-maker/) last week.
